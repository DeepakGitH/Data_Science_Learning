########## Prediction Intervals ######

1. Why is the prediction interval different from the confidence interval. The confidence intervals measure the error in the mean prediction.
the error in mean Y value for that X and mean predicted Y value for that X.

2. We also need to include the variation around the actual mean Y value for those values of Xs.
