#### Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization of Deep Networks ####

## Week 1
1. Train, Dev and Test sets. In deep learning the dev and test sets aer kept small. 
2. Dev and test set come from same distribution. The train set can be from a different distribution. 
1. High Bias - Train the network longer, deeper network or different network architecture
2. High Variance - Get the more data, regularization
