Python GENERATOR FUNCTIONS are awesome and I should use them more and more. 
It allows us to not create a list of values into memory. So the primary function is to improve memory usage. But I am not sure how it is
also making the operation faster.

- When a yield statement is called it returns a value and stores the function value. and when it is called again the next value is returned. 
It stores the fucntion state and all the values.

- Its an iterator and it can be used with a FOR loop
